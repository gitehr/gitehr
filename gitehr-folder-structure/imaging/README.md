# Imaging

This directory contains imaging-related clinical documents and metadata. The content should preferably be stored in open, non-proprietary formats. The clinical information should be imported into structured data in the journal where possible, with a link to the source document. These source documents serve as reference, provenancing, and backups.

Examples of content:

- DICOM files
- Imaging reports
- Scan metadata
- Image analysis results
