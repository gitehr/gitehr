# State

This folder contains clinical 'state' - items which are current and relevant to the patient's care but may be updated to the new state as the patient's condition changes.

All items are version controlled, so that the history of the record can be easily audited and reviewed.

All commits are signed, providing a tamper-evident log of changes.
