# Documents

This directory contains non-imaging clinical documents and metadata. The content should preferably be stored in open, non-proprietary formats. The clinical information should be imported into structured data in the journal where possible, with a link to the source document. These source documents serve as reference, provenancing, and backups.

Examples of content:

- PDF medical reports
- Correspondence
- Lab results
- Referral letters
