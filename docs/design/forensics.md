# Forensics and Medicolegal Integrity

GitEHR is engineered so that patient records remain trustworthy evidence long after they are created. With GitEHR and an open source GUI you can view any record *exactly* as it appeared at any point in the past, backed by cryptographic proof of the entries and built-in non-repudiation.

## Complete historical fidelity

* Every change to a record is preserved in Git history, letting you roll back to any earlier snapshot without relying on a mutable database.
* Because the GUI is open source and versioned alongside the record, you can view historical data with the same interface that existed when the data was captured.
* This eliminates the classic "we can't reconstruct what the doctor saw" problem and replaces it with reproducible, verifiable renderings.

## Evidence you can trust

* Digital signatures and hash-based provenance prove the veracity of each entry, ensuring clinicians cannot plausibly deny authored changes while protecting them from tampering claims.
* Legal and clinical reviewers can demonstrate exactly what information was available to a clinician at any point in time, not an approximation reconstructed from a degraded database.
* The combination of immutable history and reproducible interfaces provides accountable transparency that is as protective for clinicians as it is for patients.
