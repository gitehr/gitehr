# TODOs for GitEHR

Quick list of planned improvements and features for GitEHR, without having to make Issues for them all.

* add user config to gitehr - committer name - gpg keys - URI namespace link

* change parent hash and parent file to null and instead put the random seed in the content and URL to genesis registration (to avoid false genesis claim)

* shorten the GUID on the filename or use a fragment of a hash - no need for such a long 'uniqueness token' when we have the millisecond timestamp

* document intention to support native FHIR and openEHR (yes both)

* document and acknowledge problems we may encounter because it's SO GOOD #1 - it becomes so easy to share your entire medical record that insurance companies can request full access to it, when they probably should not be allowed

* How does GitEHR address any of the Quintuple Aims of healthcare?

* EPRs can focus on competing around UI/features
