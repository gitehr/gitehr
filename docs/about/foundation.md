title: GitEHR Foundation
---

GitEHR is currently owned and legally stewarded by **Baw Medical Ltd**. The company acts as the custodian of the GitEHR name, code, and related intellectual property while the project grows and the community matures.

The long-term vision is to transfer GitEHR into the guardianship of an independent non-profit foundation so that stewardship of the project is clearly separated from any single commercial entity. That foundation may be an existing trusted organisation or a new body created specifically to serve the GitEHR community. Once established, the foundation would hold the project assets on behalf of the community and ensure they remain openly available under permissive, community-first governance.
